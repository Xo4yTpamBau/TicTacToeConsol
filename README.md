# `Tic Tac Toe`

   Here is a simple tic-tac-toe game that works through the console (there are instructions for starting it below).

   When you start the program, it will give you a choice: an opponent, a nickname and a symbol that you want to play with. If you are playing against a person, then the player who chooses the symbol is randomly selected.

1. Follow the link

2. Copy the project to your computer.
[If you do not know how, then here is a link with instructions](https://www.lenakso.top/chto-takoe-git-clone-i-kak-klonirovat-repozitorij/)

3. Open the console and go to the directory with the project (cd "project path").

4. Below are 3 commands, just copy and paste the commands into the console. Voila, the game is running. [I hope you have a jdk)](https://lumpics.ru/how-to-install-jdk-in-windows-10/)


### `javac -d bin -sourcepath src src\com\ticTacToe\TicTacToe.java`
### `jar -cmf manifest.mf sample.jar  -C bin .`
### `java -jar .\sample.jar`

**Note: If there is a problem when executing the second command, then the jdk/bin path may not be specified in the PATH**
