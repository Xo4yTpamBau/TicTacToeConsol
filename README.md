# `Tic Tac Toe`

Here is a simple tic-tac-toe game that works through the console (there are instructions for starting it below).

When you start the program, it will give you a choice: an opponent, a nickname and a symbol that you want to play with. If you are playing against a person, then the player who chooses the symbol is randomly selected.

#### `javac -d bin -sourcepath src src\com\ticTacToe\TicTacToe.java`
#### `jar -cmf manifest.mf sample.jar  -C bin .`
#### `java -jar .\sample.jar`
